# NTU CSIE Web Programming 2025 Spring

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our assignments in the NTU CSIE Web Programming 2025 Spring course. This repository contains the source code and documentation for our group's projects, showcasing our progress in web development technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PixiJS, Django, and Docker.

## About This Project

This repository is maintained by a group of students from National Taiwan University (NTU) enrolled in the Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE) department. Our assignments focus on building an online expense tracking system for roommates, progressively enhanced with front-end and back-end technologies.

## Assignments

Below are the details of our assignments, including descriptions and demo links.

### Week 3 - Fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Description**: Built an online expense tracking system using HTML and CSS to maintain transparent financial records for roommates. Features include a login form (`<form>`), transaction record table (`<table>`), and interactive buttons (`<button>`) for toggling visibility. CSS enhances the UI with gradients and structured layouts. Basic JavaScript enables toggling transaction history, and the site is served over HTTPS.
- **Demo**: [Week 3 Demo](https://hsinchu-huang-147.tplinkdns.com:12345/week03)

### Week 5 - Advanced JavaScript with PixiJS
- **Description**: Enhanced the expense tracker with advanced JavaScript and PixiJS, a 2D graphics engine. Added debt summaries, roommate relationships, and a dynamic debt table using OOP, JavaScript methods (`.forEach()`, `.map()`, `async/await`), and template literals. PixiJS visualizes debts with interactive 2D graphics, creating an engaging front-end interface without backend integration.

### Week 7 - Backend Integration and Docker Deployment
- **Description**: Integrated the front-end with a Django REST Framework backend, adding user authentication, transaction CRUD operations, and debt calculation APIs. Connected to a MySQL database and containerized with Docker for consistent development and production environments. Optimized with Gunicorn for performance and Whitenoise for static files.
